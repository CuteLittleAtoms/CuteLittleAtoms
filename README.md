### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ike. I'm a trilingual international school student from Bangkok, Thailand, and I began programming at the age of twelve as a hobby. I can speak Thai - my mother tongue, English - also my mother tongue, and Chinese - an acquired langauge later on in life. I want to learn French and Latin, but don't have the time to do so currently.\
\
I'm currently working on my genetic algorithms project, and am making a MOOC with a fellow programmer and friend. My hobbies include reading fantasy novels, poetry, listening to pop music, and lastly but not least: **programming**.
